Okay I've been sharing a lot of stuff on social media and thinking "I should save this somewhere." I'm itching to revisit both my tumblelog experiment and my public brain experiment.

What will I put here? Mostly the stuff I've been posting all over. Some cool tech thing I saw. A silly thought I had. Maybe a bird. If my last tumblelog experiment is any indication, there will be full-on blog posts there too.

But it's also a wiki, so I'll add topic pages for things that keep coming up.

Lots of stuff I want to add, but perfection is the enemy of "good enough." I can add more later.
