Hi there!

## Who I am

I'm Brian Wisti, frequently described as random and geeky. I guess that's sort of like a brand. Most of my social network bios go with "50-something pasty he/him; not tall."

## What I do

I enjoy writing code. I enjoy deleting code even more. I go through stretches where I love writing *about* code.

Usually messing about with FOSS tools. Thanks to ADHD, I tend to find a whole lot of nifty projects out there. If it's interesting enough, I share it.

I also draw and sometimes knit.

Wrapping all this up is a fondness for personal knowledge management, so I can remember the cool stuff I saw and what I was doing the other day. In fact, this site is part of that effort.

## How to reach me

* [My primary site](https://randomgeekery.org) usually has the most reliable contact info
* you can usually rely on [email](mailto:brian.wisti@gmail.com)
* my preferred social network is the Fediverse; my main account is on [hackers.town](https://masto.hackers.town/@randomgeek/)
* I visit [BlueSky](https://bsky.app/profile/randomgeek.bsky.social) periodically
* there's a [LinkedIn profile](https://linkedin.com/in/brianwisti), of course

## Why a `/hello` page

I wanted something more than a contact page: a little about me along with the contact info, you know? `/hello` seems to fit the bill.
